# Testing Demo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Quick Start

```
npm install
npm start
```

The above commands will install dependencies and start the app. To run tests, run `npm test` on a separate command line. There are no tests written in the master branch.

**Tip:** to start the application and the mock API and open Cypress, you can use [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) utility.

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Testing libraries

This instance of create-react-app has been enhanced with the following testing libraries:

## Complete code coverage with Cypress

When you run the application with `npm start` it instruments the source code using [@cypress/instrument-cra](https://github.com/cypress-io/instrument-cra) module. The code coverage is collected using [@cypress/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) plugin and saved in `coverage` folder.
